# Why Choose Dataflow?

Dataflow began as a personal project for myself to streamline and automate video creation at scale.  
After years of working with other video automation tools, I found that many lacked essential features and came with prohibitively expensive enterprise pricing.  
Driven by the need for a more flexible and affordable option, I developed Dataflow to simplify video automation for everyone.  
Since then, I’ve continuously enhanced its capabilities and refined the user experience, with many more improvements planned for the future.

Here’s why Dataflow stands out:

### Affordable Pricing
My mission with Dataflow is to make powerful video automation accessible to individuals and small teams—not just large enterprises.  
Competing tools are often costly and restrict core features behind even higher paywalls.  
With Dataflow, you gain powerful features and save valuable time - making it a smart choice for any workflow.  
Whether you’re looking to handle bigger projects, take on more clients, or simply enjoy the freetime you gain from it, Dataflow quickly delivers a return on your investment.

### Fast & Intuitive
Dataflow is not bloated with unnecessary features that barely help anyone but make the tool slower.  
The user interface is designed for clarity, making it easy to accomplish your goals without a steep learning curve.  
Comprehensive documentation is available on this website to help you get the most out of Dataflow.

### Agent Mode
Need on-demand or 24/7 automated rendering? Agent Mode is your solution.  
The Agent scans your connected data sources for new rendering jobs and starts processing automatically—no manual intervention required.  
**A key advantage:** connect unlimited Google Sheets or unlimited local data sources at once (but not both types together).  
This lets you easily monitor multiple campaigns or projects with different data inputs—all from a single license and machine.
This feature eliminates the need to set up separate rendering machines for each project/data source, allowing you to maximize the efficiency of your existing hardware.

### User Presets
User presets allow you to create as many input field presets you need.  
Super useful for quickly switching between workflows that need entirely different output settings or data sources!  
Presets are stored locally as JSON files in **==Documents/Dataflow/DataflowSettings.json==**, making it easy to share configurations with your team.
