## Why go with Dataflow?

Dataflow started as a personal project to give myself a tool that could help me batch create videos based om data.
I already had years of experience with other video automation tools, but lack of features that were important to me and very high enterprise pricing models inspired me to develop my own tool to help with video automation tasks.
Over time I added more and more features and made the user experience smoother.
And I will continue to do so in the future.

To make your life easy, here are the main selling points of Dataflow:

### Cheap Pricing
    With launching Dataflow to the public, my goal is to make video automation more accessible to anyone who might need it.
    Comparable tools are hard to afford for individuals or small teams and often hide core functionality behind even higher paywalls.
    For the functionality Dataflow offers and the amount of output and timesaving you will gain from using it, it easily repays itself.
    Either because you will be able to create projects on a bigger scale, take on more projects, or do whatever you prefer with your extra freetime you gain from using it ;)
    
### Fast and easy
    Dataflow is not bloated with unnecessary features that barely help anyone but make the tool slower.
    The user interface is designed to make it as straight forward as possible for the user to do what he wants to do.
    Also this website holds all types of documentation one might need to get help with using Dataflow.

### Agent Mode
    For people in need for a rendering on demand solution or a 24/7 rendering worker, Agent Mode is THE way to go.
    Similarly to other tools it lets you Scan your connected Data Source for new incoming rendering jobs and start rendering without humand interaction.
    The most important **standout feature** in Agent Mode is the ability to connect however many Google Sheets or Local Data sources as you want simultaniously.
    That means you can hook up Data Sources meant for all kinds of projects and monitor them simultaniously only needing one license and machine.
    This is especially useful for people who have multiple campaigns/project rigs that all need very different data inputs where having one google sheet or tsv is not suitable.

### User Presets
    User presets allow you to create as many input field presets you need.
    Super useful for quickly switching between projects which need entirely different output settings or connected data sources!
    These settings can also be shared with colleagues since they are saved as a JSON file locally.
