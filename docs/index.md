# Welcome to Dataflow

Dataflow is a powerful Adobe After Effects extension that streamlines data-driven content creation. It enables users to connect to local data sources like **.json** or **.tsv** files, or **Google Sheets** using a free, user-provided API key, empowering you to build complex design systems and effortlessly batch-render unlimited variations from your data.

## How it Started
Dataflow began as a personal project to create data-driven content outside my workplace, where I used expensive enterprise tools to localize complex After Effects project rigs for global advertising campaigns. Recognizing the potential of data-driven video for both enterprise and personal projects, I was inspired to develop my own accessible tool to achieve this.
