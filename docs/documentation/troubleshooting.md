# Troubleshooting
In case you are experiencing issues using Dataflow, here is a list of knowledge that might help you out. Alternatively you can also report a bug or get in contact.

## Installation
!!! no-icon "Manually installing Dataflow"
    
    If installing via [ZXP Installer](https://zxpinstaller.com/) doesnt work as expected, you can try installing Dataflow manually:

    1. Rename ==Dataflow.zxp== to ==Dataflow.zip==
    2. Unzip ==Dataflow.zip== so you are left with a folder named  ==ðŸ“‚ Dataflow==
    3. Move the folder to one of the following locations:
        * On PC:
        **C:/Users/*username*/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/CEP/extensions**
        * On Mac:
        **/Users/*username*/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions**
    4. Restart your After Effects and you are good to go!

## Inside After Effects
!!! no-icon "Ensure access to files and network"
    From the After Effects preferences window, navigate to the scripting & expressions tab, and turn on `'Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network'`.
