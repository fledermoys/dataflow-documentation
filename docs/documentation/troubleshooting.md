    1. Rename ==Dataflow.zxp== to ==Dataflow.zip==
    2. Unzip ==Dataflow.zip== so you are left with a folder named  ==ðŸ“‚ Dataflow==
    3. Move the folder to one of the following locations:
        * On PC:
        **C:/Users/*username*/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/CEP/extensions**
        * On Mac:
        **/Users/*username*/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions**
    4. Restart your After Effects and you are good to go!
