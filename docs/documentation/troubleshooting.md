### Manually installing Dataflow

If installing via [ZXP Installer](https://zxpinstaller.com/) doesnt work as expected, you can try installing Dataflow manually:

1. Rename ==Dataflow.zxp== to ==Dataflow.zip==
2. Unzip ==Dataflow.zip== so you are left with a folder named  ==📂 Dataflow==
3. Move the folder to one of the following locations:
    * On PC:
    **C:/Users/*username*/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/CEP/extensions**
    * On Mac:
    **/Users/*username*/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions**
4. Restart your After Effects and you are good to go!
